# 🔐 Network Anomaly Risk Scorer — Cyber Threat Severity Prediction

This project predicts the severity of network threats using regression models trained on the UNSW-NB15 dataset. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, explainability (SHAP), and a Streamlit-based UI for real-time inference.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw and preprocessed datasets
- `models/`: Saved models
- `notebooks/`: EDA and training notebooks
- `src/`: Core Python modules (preprocessing, training, SHAP, etc.)
- `app/`: Streamlit app

## 🚀 Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_visualizer.py
```
