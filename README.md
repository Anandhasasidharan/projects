## 📂 Project Repositories

| Project Title | Description | Tags |
|---------------|-------------|------|
| [🔐 Network Anomaly Risk Scorer](https://github.com/yourusername/cyber_threat_risk_predictor) | ML regression model that predicts threat severity score based on network behavior (UNSW-NB15 dataset). SHAP used for interpretability. | `Cybersecurity` `Regression` `Explainable AI` |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Markdown
- **ML/AI Libraries**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, TensorFlow (beginner), matplotlib, seaborn
- **Cyber Datasets**: UNSW-NB15, CICIDS
- **Tools**: Jupyter, VS Code, Streamlit, Git & GitHub

## 🎯 How I Work (First Principles Thinking)

I believe in **learning deeply**, not memorizing. Every project is built from the ground up — starting from raw data or theory and building to working systems. I document each stage:

1. **Understand the fundamentals**
2. **Break the problem down**
3. **Build small, test often**
4. **Iterate with feedback**
5. **Explain what I’ve learned**
